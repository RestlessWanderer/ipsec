# IPSec Overview
This will serve as a general overview to IP Security, or `IPSec` functionality, as well as parts that are specific to Arista hardware, some different topology configurations, and finally, some troubleshooting commands specific to Arista platforms.

In general, IPSec VPNs are typically referred to as "tunnels", most often in an effort to logically view them as a method of passing traffic securely across an insecure network. In reality, IPSec VPNs are nothing more than packets that are encapsulated and encrypted, either by the endpoint, or by a device in the path, and then routed across the insecure network.  As a result, there are various pieces of this security mechanism that enable it to work.
## Components and Protocols
### Phases
In the formation of an IPSec VPN, there are two phases the endpoints go through before being able to encrypt and transmit traffic.  These are subsequently called `Phase 1` and `Phase 2`.
